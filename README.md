# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

Creating Lucrative App Profiles for App Store and Google Play Markets is the project's objective. The goal is to discover user-attractive apps and determine the app types that can generate maximum revenue. As a data analyst at a company specializing in Android and iOS app development, my role involves assisting developers in making informed decisions based on data.

This project is a data science endeavor that involves analyzing gathered app data from both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. You can access the data from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) and [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) as well.
